(Where2buy.it)[https://where2buy.it] is a search engine for products sold on physical stores. Users perform searches and find where specific products are sold and by which price. The search engine allows finding words appearing directly into Restaurants Menu's content.

Finding products is not all, as most important is to find the best products. That's why the platform uses Sentiment Analysis to read products' reviews that users have published online. Not all reviews are selected, but only the public ones that mention the specific product for that restaurant. Sentiment Analysis analyzes human language written in the phrases and determines if the customer experience was positive or negative. So the search engine can forecast the probability of a negative customer experience for that product. When a user searches, the platform shows first the results that minimize the chance of a negative customer experience.
